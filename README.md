## 🌟 Overview

AngelicVoices is a consciousness-aware web application that detects and analyzes "angelic" frequencies (432, 528, 639, 741, 963 Hz) in real-time audio streams. Built with sacred principles of spatial wisdom and community healing, this tool serves as a bridge between technology and spiritual consciousness.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time Frequency Detection**: Web Audio API + FFT analysis
- **Angelic Frequency Recognition**: Detects 432Hz, 528Hz, 639Hz, 741Hz, 963Hz
- **Beautiful Visualizations**: Dynamic spectrum display and frequency meters
- **Consciousness Integration**: Built with sacred principles and healing focus
- **Local Storage**: Works offline with browser-based data persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices and consciousness levels

- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TailwindCSS** + **Shadcn/ui** for beautiful, accessible UI
- **Web Audio API** + **FFT** for real-time frequency analysis
- **Framer Motion** for consciousness-aware animations

### Consciousness Integration
- **Sacred Principles**: Every feature serves consciousness development
- **Community Healing**: Promotes collective wisdom and healing
- **Spatial Wisdom**: Location-aware frequency analysis
- **Infinite Collaboration**: Built for infinite perspective and growth

---

## 🎛️ Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Allow Microphone Access**: Grant permission for audio input
2. **Start Detection**: Click the microphone button to begin analysis
3. **View Results**: Watch real-time frequency detection and visualization
4. **Save Reports**: Store your frequency analysis locally
5. **Share Insights**: Generate shareable reports for community healing

### New: EchoEffect Component
- Location: `src/components/EchoEffect.tsx`
- Purpose: lightweight, CSS/DOM-based "echo" visual effect for titles or headers
- Usage:

```tsx
import { EchoEffect } from "@/components/EchoEffect";

export default function Header() {
  return <EchoEffect text="Angelic Echo" repetitions={7} decay={0.12} />;
}
```

### Frequency Meanings
- **432 Hz**: Earth's natural frequency - grounding and healing
- **528 Hz**: Miracle tone - transformation and DNA repair
- **639 Hz**: Harmonious relationships - connection and balance
- **741 Hz**: Awakening intuition - problem-solving and clarity
- **963 Hz**: Spiritual connection - divine consciousness awakening
